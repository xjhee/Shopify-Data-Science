## Question1
1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this dataã€‚
Ans: The incorrect AOV is because total_items are calculated with count(), we should instead calculate them with sum() 

2. What metric would you report for this dataset?
Ans: There are several metrics I think we could consider
- sum of order amount, which can be derived by 
 ```
 df = pd.read_csv('...')
 sum_order_amount = df['order_amount'].sum()
 ```
- sum of total items, which can be derived by 
 ```
 df = pd.read_csv('...')
 sum_total_items = df['total_items'].sum()
 ```
 
3. What is its value?
Ans: AOV can be calculated by deviding sum_order_amount by sum_total_items, which gives us 357.92
```
aov = round(sum_order_amount / sum_total_items, 2)
```


## Question2

3. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
